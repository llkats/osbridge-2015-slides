            <p class="note">The goals for my talk are two-fold:</p>
            <p class="note">1. First, I want to give beginners to the terminal a sense of what it&#39;s like to work with the command-line, and of the power behind the cursor. Even if you don&#39;t get or remember everything right away, just getting a brief glimpse of everything that&#39;s available will be enough so that as you explore, you&#39;ll have a handle of things to search for and get a better sense of.</p>
            <p class="note">2. Second, I want to give everyone, beginners through experts, an idea of the sorts of customization you can do with the command line, to make it more communicative, to really make it your own.</p>
            <p class="note">I'll start with some history of computer interfaces, then start talking about three different shells (different programs for issuing text commands), and walk through different usages of each. There&#39;s a lot of information, and I will be sure to post my slides, my notes, my sources, and you can always ask me for more info at the end.</p>

            <p class="note">Before I dive in, I want to explain my motivations for starting with the history of the development of computer interaction. Engineers didn&#39;t set out to make opaque and frustrating interfaces. these things evolved out of technological constraints of the time, which included extremely limited computer speed and power. Those original machines were huge, expensive, they were centralized and access was strictly controlled. They were far less powerful than any smartphone we might carry around in our bags today. </p>
            <p class="note">If you look at the command line and think, &quot;this is not my beautiful desktop, these are not my beautiful programs&quot; then understanding how people interacted with those first machines might help contextualize the reason for the terse, short commands and limited interface.</p>
            <p class="note">So, how did we get here?</p>

            <p class="note">In a book on Unix Usability, Eric Steven Raymond and Rob W. Landley wrote, &quot;Users had to accommodate computers rather than the other way around; user interfaces were considered overhead, and software was designed to keep the processor at maximum utilization with as little overhead as possible.</p>
            <p class="note">...The turnaround time for a single job often spanned entire days.&quot;</p>
            <p class="note">That's a really long time to go before you find out that you got a compiler error from, say, a forgotten semicolon</p>
            <p class="note">In a day and age where user interface, UI, UX, and design are all highly valued and discussed, the fact that computing power was limited to the point of considering user interface as overhead is just a completely foreign mindset.</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">To move on from punch cards, there were several innovations that were key to the evolution of computer interfaces. </p>
            <p class="note">First, batch monitors were programs that were developed to run on computers constantly and be available to provide services to programs as they were executed. They also could do error reporting and give better messaging when errors occurred.</p>
        </div>

            <p><img src="./img/ASR-33_at_CHM.agr.jpg" width="400" alt="An old teleprinter machine."></p>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">Then teleprinters were hooked up to these batch monitors. Teleprinters were like electronic typewriters crossed with telegrams. They&#39;d been around since the early 20th century, and were originally used to communicate human-to-human, but with the advent of batch monitor programs, a teleprinter could be used to issue commands to a computer and receive output in turn.</p>
            <p class="note">They were still kind of clunky and inefficient, not to mention all the paper waste just printing out commands, but it was much quicker than the punch card system. Now people could receive feedback in almost real time.</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">Finally, video displays replaced teleprinters in the mid &#39;70&#39;s. now this finally looks kind of familiar, like what many of us would actually identify as computers today.</p>
            <p class="note">But even though it looks a lot like a computer, this was not actually a computer. this picture is of a <strong>terminal</strong>. If you disconnected it and moved it elsewhere, it wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything, because it had no hard drives, memory, or processors. This was simply an interface to the actual computer itself. </p>
            <p class="note">To use a computer, you had to go and sit at a terminal like this one, type in your commands, and receive the output to the display.</p>

            <p class="note">And that&#39;s basically the invention of the command line we know and love today. Compared to punch cards and teleprinters, they are way faster! You get immediate feedback! You can even change things on the fly in response to the output you get! Neat!</p>
            <p class="note">But <strong>is</strong> a tradeoff.</p>
            <p class="note">Raymond and Landley note that &quot;These interfaces still placed a relatively heavy mnemonic load on the user, requiring a serious investment of effort and learning time to master.&quot;</p>
            <p class="note">...and that&#39;s still pretty true today</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">The Graphical User Interface that we&#39;re all familiar with was developed as an alternative to the command line interface.</p>
            <p class="note">It was a reaction to the steep learning curve perceived around the command line. When you use a GUI, you directly interact with the graphical representations of files and actions. </p>
            <p class="note">These interfaces were enabled by the inventions of video displays and input devices like the mouse. but the command line came first, a terse interface for a more technologically limited time.</p>

            <p class="note">Automation is your friend, and can be a lot easier to write on the command line. Tasks like enumeration or find-and-replace tasks, which can be kind of tedious, become an interesting challenge when you can write a program to do it for you.</p>
            <p class="note">For example, if you want to install a new application, you could install it by hand, or use a package manager like Homebrew for Mac OS to install, manage dependencies, update, and uninstall things for you with just a couple short commands.</p>

            <p class="note">But I also want to make the point that we don&#39;t have to take the command line as-is. Even though there are some really good reasons for why the command line is the way that it is, it also can still be better. It&#39;s terse to the point of being wholly unintelligible. We spend a lot of time with our tools, and the command line doesn&#39;t have to be a hostile or unaccomodating environment. It just takes a little more effort and a little more learning to make it friendly and expressive.</p>

            <p class="note">For example, I recently discovered my friend&#39;s vim configuration. vim is a complex, powerful text editor that can be accessed from the command line. I&#39;d mistaken it for some time as Sublime Text, a desktop GUI app, which is what I use to do the majority of my coding.

            <p class="note">The command-line interpreter (CLI), or the shell, is the application that runs inside the terminal itself. It sits there waiting for input, executes that input, and returns the results, like a control center or a conduit.</p>

For now, I just want to note that one of the most widespread shells is called <code>bash</code>. It was created by an engineer named Brian Fox in 1989, when he was working for Richard Stallman&#39;s Free Software Foundation.</p>
            <p class="note"><code>bash</code> inherits a lot of characteristics from earlier shells like the Bourne shell, c shell, the korn shell, and even the original <code>sh</code> shell that was shipped with the first version of unix. <code>bash</code> was first shipped with Unix version 7.</p>

            <p class="note">Fortunately, there is on-board documentation for every command in right in the shell. If you want to read the documentation for a command, type &quot;m-a-n&quot;, short for manual, followed by a space, followed by the command name. This is some sample output for the &quot;echo&quot; command.</p>
            <p class="note">You can also google commands for help, I do that a lot as well, since the documentation inside the shells can be a bit dry or dense</p>

            <p class="note">Let&#39;s see what it&#39;s like to work in <code>bash</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">Starting off, this particular default implementation of <code>bash</code> shows the shell we&#39;re using, which is <code>bash</code>, and the version of <code>bash</code> running, 3.2. The dollar sign starts the area where we can type. This whole string of things is called the &quot;prompt&quot;</p>
            <p class="note">We can type whatever after the prompt; if there&#39;s invalid input, <code>bash</code> gives an error.</p>
            <p class="note">We can see where we are in our directory by typing in the command <code>pwd</code> and pressing enter. Looks like I&#39;m in my home directory. We can change directories with the command <code>cd</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">To change directories, I have to type in a valid file path to a folder. Let&#39;s change to the folder (or directory, same thing) where I&#39;ve been developing this talk. <code>~/Dropbox/osbridge</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">The tilde character is short for my home directory, so the file paths that I type are in relation to that directory. It&#39;s a shortcut so I don&#39;t have to type <code>/Users/lydia</code> the entire time. if I press the &quot;tab&quot; key on an incomplete folder name, <code>bash</code> is smart enough to try to help me out and autocomplete the names and save me some keystrokes.</p>
            <p class="note">And I can see what&#39;s in a folder by just typing <code>ls</code>, so it prints out the list of most of the things in the folder. If I type <code>ls</code> followed by a valid folder name, I can see what&#39;s inside that folder. <code>ls pics</code> shows all of the images i&#39;m using in my talk.</p>
            <p class="note">I can make a folder with the command <code>mkdir</code>, followed by the name I want. I&#39;m going to make the folder <code>demo</code>. Then I can <code>cd</code> into that new directory.</p>
            <p class="note">I can then make a new empty file with the command <code>touch</code>, followed again by the name I want. Running <code>ls</code> again shows that new file is present inside this folder.</p>
            <p class="note">You might notice me typing the word <code>clear</code> a lot, this is to clear the current window so that my prompt is at the very top. I&#39;m doing this so hopefully everyone can see a little better.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">And finally, the fun bits: customization. &quot;<code>bash</code> configures its prompt by using the <code>PS1</code> and the <code>PS2</code> environment variables.&quot;, which are system properties that the shell keeps track of. &quot;<code>PS1</code> defines the primary prompt that you will see.&quot;</p>
            <p class="note">We can type experiments with the prompt right inside the terminal, just by assigning characters to the PS1 prompt. So let&#39;s give it a shot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">The first thing to do is type in <code>capital-P capital-S number-1</code> followed by an <code>=</code> sign, and then start a string, single or double quote doesn&#39;t matter. Followed by... something. Let&#39;s go with a simple smiley face. I&#39;m going to add a space after that, so it&#39;s easier to read commands that I type in after that. Then close the string with a followup quote character.</p>
            <p class="note"><code>PS1=&quot;:) &quot;</code></p>
            <p class="note">So, that prompt&#39;s cute. But let&#39;s make it a little more informative. Maybe we could put the user I&#39;m logged in as in the prompt. I can press the <code>up</code> arrow key to get to my last command, and just edit that. </p>
            <p class="note"><code>bash</code> has special shorthand characters called &quot;escape sequences&quot; that are like environment variables. You can see them all if you run <code>man bash</code>. If I insert the escape sequence <code>\u</code> I get my username. If I insert <code>\h</code>, we see the hostname, which is the name of my computer on the network. And <code>\w</code> gives the current directory, which is what would be output by the command <code>pwd</code>, so we can see where we are.</p>
            <p class="note">and maybe it&#39;s time for an emoji. anyone have a favorite one?</p>
            <p class="note"><code>PS1=&quot;\u@\h:\w   &quot;</code></p>
            <p class="note">Cool, that&#39;s everything. If we cd somewhere, you will see the prompt change accordingly.</p>

            <p class="note">So right now, this prompt stays the same, but if I open a new <code>bash</code> session, it&#39;ll revert to the old prompt.</p>
            <p class="note">To make our prompt changes permanent, we have to save this <code>PS1</code> variable inside a configuration file called <code>.bashrc</code></p>
            <p class="note">This is the file that <code>bash</code> reads when it starts up, to understand what to do and read settings. It&#39;s usually invisible on your computer because the file is started with a dot, and since those are usually configuration files, they&#39;re kept invisible by default.</p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">So, if the <code>.bashrc</code> file is invisible, how can we see it? Fortunately, the <code>ls</code> command as an option called <code>-A</code>. We can see that by opening the documentation for <code>ls</code> by using the command <code>man</code> short for manual, followed by <code>ls</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">Finally, the tilde in that command is a shorthand for your home directory, as I mentioned earlier. If <code>.bashrc</code> doesn&#39;t show up, you can simply create it there.</p>
            <p class="note">A Mac gotcha: OS X handles <code>bash</code> settings differently than linux/unix. I don&#39;t have time to get in the nitty-gritty here, but the summary is that you might have to edit a file called <code>.bash_profile</code> instead. </p>

            <p class="note">I want to move on to the other two shells that I wanted to introduce to you today, but most of these things we&#39;ve gone through with <code>bash</code> will be applicable to <code>zsh</code> and <code>fish</code> as well. If you want to get going with <code>bash</code>, there are a lot of great resources to help you customize it out there. This Digital Ocean article, &quot;How to Customize your Bash Prompt on a Linux VPS&quot; by Jusin Ellingwood has some Linux-specific stuff at the beginning, but the later information on customizing <code>bash</code> is general and really approachable, and gets in to adding color to your <code>bash</code> prompt.</p>

            <p class="note">One of the most powerful things about <code>fish</code>, in my experience, is its active autocompletions. You might be taken aback at first by all this text flashing at you as you build a command, but this sort of realtime feedback has been just invaluable to me becoming more comfortable on the command line. </p>
            <p class="note">Commands are red until they are valid, and they become blue. You can tab to complete the suggestion partway, you can tab to see valid places in folders. <code>fish</code> tries to give you as much information as possible as you go.</p>
            <p class="note"><code>zsh</code> has a lot of the same features, but it&#39;s really the realtime feedback that makes it so compelling for me.</p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">
            <p class="note">Unlike <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code> which have clear legacies going back to the Bourne shell, <code>fish</code> took a wholly different approach, and so it has some syntax incompatibilities with <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code>. You have to learn how to declare and script the <code>fish</code> way, and that can have some downsides.</p>
            <p class="note">Just a small example is the sublist operator (as zsh calls it). You can run multiple commands in sequence in <code>bash</code> and <code>zsh</code> with the <code>ampersand ampersand</code> operator; for example, you can <code>git clone</code> a new repository and the immediately <code>cd</code> into the new folder that git created in one command. But in <code>fish</code>, you have to actually type the word &quot;and&quot; instead of the ampersands, and that&#39;s just one example.</p>
            <p class="note">Since <code>fish</code> is not as popular as <code>bash</code>, sometimes certain command-line tools or open source projects might not have <code>fish</code> support. Or you might find a neat shell script someone wrote, but then need to tweak or change it so <code>fish</code> is happy.</p>
